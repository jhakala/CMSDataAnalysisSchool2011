Step 1)

Produce PAT tuples and custom-made trees. Use crab submission for Data, PY6 QCD and EWK backgrounds. 
Use interactive jobs for BH signal samples.

Step 2)
a) cp -r /uscmst1b_scratch/lpc1/lpctrig/aferapon/CMSDataAnalysisSchool2011/MacrosThirdDraftTest .
   cd MacrosThirdDraftTest
   mkdir Results
 
.x plot_initial_distr.C -- produce various distributions in data and MC

b) Produce 1) Multiplicity (0 - 20 range) - note high values for signal, concentrate on high mult events only.
	      Note: for this plot, do not apply any requirements (req variable)	
	      This root file will also be used as a reference file for acceptance calculation. Must have!	
		Quiz: is it as expected? Why?
	   2) ST, mBH, Met, NJets, NElectrons, NMuons for Multiplicity>=2
	   	Quiz: find two variables with possible good signal-background discriminating power. Why? 
			
c) Must have: 	ST distributions for Multiplicity==2, ==3, >=3, >=4, >=5, and >=6
d) The rest:	up to users

Step 3) 

a) .x plot_qcd_shape.C -- Plot QCD shapes of ST, mBH. Out of ST and mBH which variable will you pick as a discriminator?
		Quiz: Why this one and not the other one?
		
b) Fitting Multiplicity==2 and Multiplicity==3 distributions
.x ddm_fit.C
		Quiz: give numerical results of fit-0 for Mult == 2 and ==3

Step 4)
.x  normalization.C -- estimate normalization factors for higher multiplicities

a) Must have:	normalization of Multiplicity==2 to : ==2, ==3, >=3, >=4, >=5, >=6
Note: norm 2 to >=6 might require manual input, since fit is not good
Note: force 1.0 +/- 0.0 scale factor for Multiplicity==2, as no additional scaling is needed!
b) The rest:	up to users
		Quiz: give numerical results for all 6 mult. choices
		
Step 5)
.x shape_background_systematics.C -- estimate systematic uncertainty on background due to variations in fitting functions
		Quiz: is the behavior expected?  Give numerical results 
		of shape systematics for ST = 1000, ST = 1500, ST = 2000, ST = 3000, and ST = 4000 

Step 6)
.x plot_significance.C -- find optimal selection criteria for each signal sample

a) Must have:	hall_bh234, bh2354, bh244, bh2454, bh254, sb11, sb12, and sb13
   
   Note1: 	to toggle between analyzed signal samples, modify lines 59, 62, 65, and 68.
   Note2: 	round STmin to hundreds, not 50's. Write down STmin and min. Mult for each signal sample
		Quiz: do these numbers make sense? (in terms of "STmin" cut - is it anywhere around 
		values where signal cross section gets larger than QCD cross section [see plots from 
		Step 2]). Was it possible to roughly estimate them from plots from Step 2?
Step 7)
.x plot_final_distr.C -- produce final ST distributions for inclusive Multiplicities 

a) Must have:	Multiplicity==2, ==3, >=3, >=4, >=5, and >=6
b) Note:	Calculate the acceptance for each sample. Write down the following numbers:
-- STmin, Mult min, Ndata, NQCD +/- dNQCD, A +/- dA, 
Note: use 5% as dA/A (JEC 5% (+) PDF 2% ~ 5%) 
		Quiz: provide numbers in the following sequence - sample name, STmin, Multmin, Ndata, Nqcd +/- dNqcd, A +/- dA

Step 8)

a) Edit blackhole_limits.C and stringball_limits.C -- input numbers from Step 5
b) 
root -l
.L cl95cms.c++
.x blackhole_limits.C

Extract the limit on min M_BH in TeV. Appreciate the difference in "visual" limits with LIN and LOG scales
		Quiz: Provide numerical values for obs. and exp. cross sections for all 8 signal samples    

c) 
.x stringball_limits.C

Extract limits.

Step 9) Advanced
Verify systematics due to objects energy scale

Do:
a) 
root -l /uscmst1b_scratch/lpc1/lpctrig/aferapon/CMSDataAnalysisSchool2011/Data/jetenriched_run2010b_exo_v2_387_35pb.root
BHAnalyzer->cd()
t->MakeClass()

b) Modify t.C to get the variables etc, or simply run:
root -l -q energyscale_signal_systematics.C+

Note:		Make sure to use correct STmin and Multmin values from Step 6

Tweak JEC by +/-5%; 
Ele, Ph, Mu EC by +/- 3% 
Calculate acceptance difference in % - use it as systematics!

		Quiz: provide numerical values of systematics for all 8 ("+" and "-") tweaks 
		for one (or all) signal samples. At least for BH MPl=2 MBH=3 N=4
